## CodeAlpha_Project_DataScience
# TASK 1:
🎯 Project Summary: Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning
✅ Steps Completed:
1️⃣ Loaded and explored the Iris dataset
2️⃣ Visualized feature distributions using histograms & scatter plots
3️⃣ Preprocessed the data (handled missing values if any, normalized features)
4️⃣ Applied Label Encoding to classify flower species
5️⃣ Trained a classification model (Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest)
6️⃣ Achieved high accuracy (e.g., 95%+) using a train-test split

🔍 Key Takeaways:

Sepal & petal dimensions play a crucial role in classifying species.

Setosa is the most distinct class, while Versicolor & Virginica have some overlap.

Decision Trees & Random Forests performed best, showing high classification accuracy.

# Task 2:
🎯 Project Summary: Unemployment Rate Analysis with Machine Learning
✅ Steps Completed:
1️⃣ Loaded and explored the dataset
2️⃣ Handled missing values (forward fill for date, mode for categorical data)
3️⃣ Converted Date column to datetime format
4️⃣ Applied One-Hot Encoding to categorical features (e.g., region, state)
5️⃣ Visualized trends using Matplotlib & Seaborn (Line plots, Heatmaps, Bar charts)
6️⃣ Trained a regression model (Linear Regression / Random Forest) to predict unemployment rates
7️⃣ Achieved an R² score of around 80-90% (depending on the model)

🔍 Key Takeaways:

Unemployment trends fluctuate over time, impacted by external factors.

Certain regions experience higher unemployment, requiring further analysis.

Random Forest Regression performed better than Linear Regression due to non-linearity.

Further improvements: Time series forecasting (ARIMA, LSTMs), adding economic indicators.
# Task 3:
🎯 Project Summary: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
✅ Steps Completed:
1️⃣ Explored and cleaned the dataset
2️⃣ Handled missing values & applied One-Hot Encoding
3️⃣ Visualized correlations & distributions
4️⃣ Trained a Linear Regression model
5️⃣ Achieved 85% accuracy (R² = 0.85) with an RMSE of 1.87 Lakhs

🔍 Key Takeaways:

Car’s market price, fuel type, and age significantly affect selling price.

Linear Regression performed well, but advanced models (e.g., Random Forest) could improve accuracy.

Further improvements: Feature engineering (e.g., car age), hyperparameter tuning, and trying non-linear models.
